# POS Inteligente - System Architecture

## Overview

The POS Inteligente system follows a microservices-oriented architecture designed for scalability, reliability, and maintainability. This document describes the high-level architecture, key components, and design decisions.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Each service has a clearly defined responsibility and communicates through well-defined interfaces. This makes the system easier to understand, develop, and maintain.

### 2. API-First Design
All services expose RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation. This enables:
- Multiple client types (web, mobile, desktop)
- Easy integration with third-party systems
- Clear contracts between frontend and backend

### 3. Offline-First
The system is designed to function without internet connectivity:
- Local data caching in IndexedDB
- Transaction queuing when offline
- Automatic synchronization when connection restored

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
Critical business events are published to a message bus, enabling:
- Real-time updates across terminals
- Audit logging
- Integration with external systems

## Communication Architecture

### gRPC (HTTP/2)
Used for service-to-service communication:
- **Native HTTP/2**: Multiplexing, flow control, header compression
- **Bidirectional Streaming**: Real-time data synchronization
- **Protocol Buffers**: Efficient binary serialization
- **Strong Typing**: Code generation from proto files

### WebSocket
Used for event-driven real-time updates:
- **Browser Compatible**: Works with web clients
- **Event Broadcasting**: Push notifications to clients
- **Lightweight**: For simple event messages
- **Fallback Option**: When gRPC-Web isn't suitable

### REST API
Used for simple CRUD operations:
- **Web Admin**: Standard HTTP/JSON for admin panel
- **Third-party Integration**: Easy external access
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger spec

## System Components

### Frontend Layer

#### Web Application (React + TypeScript)
The primary user interface built with modern web technologies:
- **React**: Component-based UI with hooks
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the application
- **Vite**: Fast development and optimized builds
- **Service Workers**: Offline functionality
- **WebSockets**: Real-time updates

### Backend Layer

#### API Service (Go)
The core business logic server:
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain, Application, Infrastructure layers
- **gRPC Server**: Service-to-service communication via HTTP/2
- **REST API**: Client-facing operations via HTTP/JSON
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time event broadcasting
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure, stateless authentication

### Data Layer

#### PostgreSQL (Primary Database)
- Stores all transactional data
- ACID compliance for financial operations
- Advanced indexing for performance
- Full-text search capabilities

#### Redis (Cache & Sessions)
- Session management
- API response caching
- Real-time data pub/sub
- Temporary data storage

### External Integrations

#### Ministry of Finance API
- Electronic invoice generation
- Tax compliance reporting
- Real-time validation

#### OpenAI API
- Voice-to-text processing
- Natural language understanding
- Predictive analytics

## Data Flow

### Sale Transaction Flow
```
1. User initiates sale in frontend
2. Frontend validates data locally
3. Request sent to API server
4. API validates business rules
5. Transaction stored in PostgreSQL
6. Event published to Redis
7. Electronic invoice generated
8. Response sent to frontend
9. Other terminals receive update via WebSocket
```

### Voice Search Flow
```
1. User speaks command
2. Audio captured in browser
3. Sent to backend API
4. Backend forwards to OpenAI Whisper
5. Text extracted and processed
6. NLP interprets command
7. Search performed in database
8. Results returned to frontend
```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- Refresh token rotation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-tenant data isolation

### Data Protection
- TLS encryption for all communications
- Database encryption at rest
- Sensitive data hashing (passwords, PINs)
- PCI compliance for payment data

### API Security
- Rate limiting per user/IP
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

## Scalability Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless API servers
- Load balancer distribution
- Database read replicas
- Redis cluster for caching

### Performance Optimization
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategy (Redis)
- CDN for static assets
- Image optimization

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Hot reload for rapid development
- Local database instances
- Mock external services

### Production Environment
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Auto-scaling based on load
- Health checks and monitoring
- Blue-green deployments

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging
- Structured JSON logging
- Centralized log aggregation
- Log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Request tracing with correlation IDs

### Metrics
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Custom business metrics
- Performance monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking

### Alerting
- Critical error notifications
- Performance degradation alerts
- Business anomaly detection
- Integration with PagerDuty/Slack

## Technology Decisions

### Why Go for Backend?
- Excellent performance for high-throughput systems
- Strong concurrency model with goroutines
- Simple deployment (single binary)
- Strong standard library

### Why React for Frontend?
- Large ecosystem and community
- Component reusability
- Virtual DOM for performance
- Excellent TypeScript support

### Why PostgreSQL?
- ACID compliance for financial data
- Advanced features (JSON, full-text search)
- Excellent performance
- Strong consistency guarantees

### Why Redis?
- Sub-millisecond latency
- Pub/sub for real-time features
- Simple data structures
- Proven scalability

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements
- GraphQL API alongside REST
- Event sourcing for audit trail
- CQRS for complex queries
- Mobile applications

### Potential Challenges
- Multi-region deployment
- Real-time sync optimization
- Handling network partitions
- Compliance with changing regulations
